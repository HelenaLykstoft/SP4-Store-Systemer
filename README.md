### 1. Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

**Member 1:**

1.  **What is meant by “Essential SAFe”?**  
    _Answer:_
    
2.  **What is an ART – why is it important?**  
    _Answer:_
    
3.  **There are 7 core competencies in SAFe – what are they?**  
    _Answer:_
    
4.  **What are 3 benefits of SAFe?**  
    _Answer:_
    
5.  **What could be the downsides of SAFe?**  
    _Answer:_
    

**Member 2:**

6.  **What in SAFe is the difference between a user story and an enabler story?**  
    
    **User stories** are the primary way of describing needed functionality. They are written following a simple, user-centric format like so: 
    > *As a (user role), I want to (activity) so that (business value)*
    
    
    The user in the user story can be the end user, but may also be a device or another system.
   
    
    Writing user stories increases the team's business domain understanding, since they figure out who uses the system, how they use it, and why. 


	**Enabler stories** focus on describing the technical improvements needed to implement new functionality. They can be written in a technical language.

	
	The enabler story can include research, refactoring, architecture, infrastructure, compliance, performance testing, and more. 


	Enabler stories may not directly deliver any value for the end user, but they make it easier for the team to continue developing. 
    
7.  **How can XP be used in SAFe teams?**  
    
    **Extreme Programming** (XP) is a set of agile software development practices that promote a high software quality and improved responsiveness to changing requirements. 
    
    SAFe also wants to promote high software quality and uses a set of practices called *Built-In Quality*, some of which are inspired by XP. In Built-In Quality, these following practices are mentioned; 
    - Pairing and Peer Review
    - Continuous Integration
    - Continuous Delivery
    - Test-first Practices
    - Refactoring
    
	These practices are all also present in XP, therefore it makes sense to use XP in SAFe.
    
8.  **SAFe is a Lean Agile framework – what does Lean mean here?**  
     
    Lean refers to principles from **Lean Thinking**, or earlier *Lean manufacturing*. The goal of Lean Thinking is to deliver maximum value to a customer in the shortest sustainable time. 
    
    The principles are:
    - Precisely specify value by product 
    - Identify the Value Steam for each product
    - Make value flow without interruptions
    - Let the customer pull value from the producer
    - Pursue perfection
    
    
    Together the principles emphasize the importance of understanding the customers' needs, having a continuous flow of work, reducing delays and waste, and continuing to improve.  
    
9.  **In PI planning risk is measured using ROAM – what does ROAM mean?**  
     
    **ROAM** is a risk management method and is used to assess and categorize risks. It stands for Resolved, Owned, Accepted, and Mitigated, which are the different categories of risks. 
    - **_Resolved_** means that the risk is no longer a concern.
    - **_Owned_** means that someone will take responsibility of the risk, and it is up to them to take further actions to manage the risk.
    - **_Accepted_** means that the risk is acknowledged, but accepted as is.
    - **_Mitigated_** means that steps will be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk.


	A ROAM board can be used as a visual tool to show when risks move category or when new risks emerge.


	A benefit of ROAM is the collaborative approach, which encourages the team to work together to assess and manage risks, and also creates a system of accountability. It is also proactive, which can save the team money, effort, and stress in the long run.
    
10. **How does the Product Owner fit into the ART team?**  
	The **Product Owner** (PO) is the ART team's primary customer advocate and their main responsibility is maximizing the value delivered the ART team. To accomplice this, the PO has five key responsibilities:
	- Connecting with the customer
	- Contributing to the vision and roadmap
	- Managing and prioritizing the Team Backlog
	- Supporting the team in delivering value
	- Getting and applying feedback

	The PO will ensure that the right thing is build the right way by collaborating closely with the ART team and also the Product Manager.
	
11. **What is the SAFe DevOps health assessment and how might it be useful?**  
	SAFe mentions that it is essential to measure the DevOps' performance and track incremental progress. To do so ART teams can use the **DevOps Health Radar**, which assesses the maturity of the Continuous Delivery Pipeline's four aspects and 16 activities.
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd7450e-ef09-40d4-a45e-6cd65926b429)


	When using the DevOps Health Rader, the ART team goes through a list of the 16 activities, - four activities for each aspect - reviews a statement that describe the team's abilities specific to the activity, and then they rate themselves as a team on a scale of 1 - 10. As an example, this is the statement to rate for the first aspect; *Continuous Exploration* and its first activity; *Hypothesize*:

	>Measurement involves collecting factual information about the value of a deployed Feature and evaluating it against the original hypothesis statement.
	Rate your team's ability to collect objective information about the actual value realized by Features, so that it can inform strategic financial decisions.
	
	And then there's a provided description for every other rating, e.g. 1 and 2 have a description in common, and 3-4, and so on.

### 2. The Spotify Model

**Member 3:**

1.  **Explain why The Spotify Model is much less formal than SAFe.**  
    _Answer:_
    Seeing as the spotify model is based on agile principles much like SAFe, the less formal approach is could be due to the emphasize on team autonomy, flexibility and lightweight coordination over tigid structures and standardized processes. Prioritizing empowering squads, the small cross-functional teams to own and make their own decisions about their products independently, reduces the need for centralized control while safe prescribes specific roles and events to coordinate work across an organization. but also providing high-level structure for team alignments like the squads, tribes, m chapters and open guilds but leaving specifics up to individual teams. whereas SAFe has a more predefined approach to roles and ceremonies.
    
    Also by encouraging communication through the informal communities like the guilds and chapters makes it less formal than SAFe's scheduled events and reporting lines.
    
    Lastly spotify seems to encourage teams to experiment, adapt, and pivot quickly without getting bogged down by process requirements. Safe, while also adaptable is designed for enterprises that need high level predictability and alignment across large complex orgs making it much more structured and formally aligned.
    
    So by relying on flexible, decentralized teams and lightweight informal coordination and communication is what makes spotify that much less formal than safes detailed and rigid structures and processes.
    
2.  **How is it a way of working with fewer events and more focus on team and team coordination?**  
    _Answer:_
    Alignment enables autonomy, loosely coupled, tightly aligned squads because of the high alignment and high autonomy it enables the teams to focus on team coordination to solve their tasks also called aligned autonomy.  So the main focus of the Spotify Model is to focus on creating these autonomous, cross-functional teams referred to as squads, that are empowered to own specific areas of a product or platform. These squads reduces the dependencies and need for constant cross-team coordination by giving each squad end-to-end ownership of their domains, so they don't rely on other teams to work more independently, which in turn decreases the number of events or meetings needed for coordination.
    
    
    With high autonomy and clear missions ideally each squad could function like a small startup-like workforce with clear objectives and responsibilities, encouraging themselves to be more self-sufficient. The less each squad relies on other teams the higher amount of focus, coordination and self-sufficiency in the individual squad is achieved
    
    
    Using stuff like tribes, chapters and guilds for coordination also allows for a more organic alignment with specific business areas.


	 Larger groups called "tribes" consists of related squads, chapters and guilds cross-cut these tribes to foster specialized knowledge sharing so, so alignment on tools, processes, and practices happens asynchronously or through occasional gatherings rather than frequent, centralized meetings. all in all when speaking of tribes, chapters and guilds its about community over structure. **(jeg inkluderer screenshot / model af tribes, guilds og squads da det er svært at visualizere uden billede)**
    
    
    With all this said, the spotify model doesn't seem to eliminate meetings altogether. But focuses on having strategic, periodic gatherings rather than constant check-ins (like standups) Agile ceremonies and quarterly planning help align on broader objectives without micromanaging day-to-day tasks.
    
3.  **Both Scrum and Kanban can be used with the Spotify model. What are the main differences between Scrum and Kanban?**  
    _Answer:_
    **Scrum** operates in sprints, running over fixed lengths, usually over 1-4 weeks. Each sprint begins with some sort of planning, followed by development and ends with a review and retrospective.
    
    Whereas **Kanban** has a continuous flow model with no fixed timeframes allowing work items to move through stages as capacity allows without constraint of a sprint.


	Kanban is a project management framework that relies on visual tasks to manage workflows, while scrum is a project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices.
    
4.  **What is a Guild, and how could you use Guilds in the exam project development process?**  
    _Answer:_
    Guild is a lightweight community of interest where people across the whole company gather and share knowledge in a specific area, guilds typically have a mailing list biannual on conferences and other informal communication methods meant to facilitate knowledge sharing, align practices and foster innovation in specific areas. Unlike formal team structures, guilds are open. and anyone can leave and join any guild at any time. Voluntary groups that span different squads and tribes, allowing members to connect discuss best practices and collaborate on common challenges without disrupting their primary work.


    We could use guilds and mostly already are using guilds as informal groups for team members with shared interests. you could argue that study groups is a form of guilds or how helping each other between study groups, sharing ideas and asking for help is a form of usage of guilds in a real world example like fashion.
    
    Using guilds would allow us to foster knowledge sharing through areas like code reviews and brain storming openly, sharing insights, resources and helping the team stay current on specialized topics.
it could also help us with aligning standards, like coding standards, design guidelines, maybe even ubiquitous language.
By supporting one another and providing a platform that allows exploring new tools or techniques fosters a good workflow, and could improve the projects quality
